** An interactive map of Taroudant's Arab souk (market) in Morocco. ** 

Kat Dawes 

This web app is designed to allow you to find your way, offline or online, around the lovely Arab souk in Taroudant. 

The souk is a maze of little covered streets and side-alleys with lots of entrances and exits, corners and squares. Getting lost in here is part of the experience, but sometimes you just want to find that awesome basket shop again, or escape to the main square for a break from the haggling. Having never found a map of the place, I walked around it filming and taking photos, and created myself a map. I wanted this to be available to all guests at La Maison Anglaise (the best guesthouse in Morocco) and everyone else visiting this small but vibrant town. Use the map and save your energy for bartering! 

What can you buy in the souk? 
- Leather goods - slippers, pouffes, belts, bags 
- Basketry - ornamental and useful bags, lampshades, woven dishes, tagine-shaped pots with no real use but fabulous darling 
- Lighting - mosaic lampshades, mirrored and stained glass lamps
- Jewellery - traditional beads and gorgeous silverware in the jewellery quarter from heaven 
- Pottery - tagines, tiles, pots, soap dishes, salt & pepper sets, dip trays, teapots and glasses 
- Dates, nuts, spices, kif (just kidding, don't risk it, find some sheba instead), kohl (check it has no lead), perfumes, herbs, tea, coffee
- Honey (orange omg yum) and amlou (nut paste, divine) deserve a special category 
- Clothing - djellabas (robes), funky trousers, knockoff designer kit, knitted hats, lush scarves
- Homewares - textile hangings, rugs, carpets, cushions, throws
- And so much more... 

Updates and suggestions are welcome, but this is a hobby project which I don't have a lot of time to update. Yes I would like to do this for the Berber market, but that place is a law unto itself which you just gotta dive into really. Most of the info is from my own extensive (expensive) research over three visits, but some has been taken from the net. Not intended to be a serious project or anything to rely on for your life.
